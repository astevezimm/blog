<h2>Self Reflection</h2>

	<h4>Acted Upon</h4>
	I open myself, so the door can enter in.<br>
	It has a keyhole in the shape of a key.<br>
	<br>
	I go home, let my shoes kick me off<br>
	That I may allow my couch to rest,<br>
	Then talk relentlessly to the TV.<br>
	<br>
	But wait, what is that noise?<br>
	The fridge growls at my stomach,<br>
	So I allow it to eat me;<br>
	I am a tasty snack.<br>
	<br>
	The couch returns,<br>
	The TV continues to stare.<br>
	For the rest of the evening,<br>
	The hands on the clock spin me around.<br>

	<h4>Caterpillar</h4>
	The caterpillar has an insatiable appetite,<br>
	An alimentary canal that crawls,<br>
	Eating the wings of the butterfly in my hand<br>
	<br>
	As it says, “Pay no attention to what you see.<br>
	For I’ll be a bigger, better butterfly.”<br>
	<br>
	I know it’s lying, but I stand paralyzed<br>
	And the lactic acid burns.<br>
	<br>
	A tumor expands which I pretend<br>
	Is just another appendage.<br>
	<br>
	In the meantime,<br>
	Not a thread of a cocoon is made.<br>
	The caterpillar eats, eats, eats,<br>
	And pacifies with lies.<br>

	<h4>Candy Store</h4>
	I’m but a lad.<br>
	I press my hand against the glass,<br>
	Peering into the candy store.<br>
	<br>
	Red and white peppermint ribbons<br>
	Do their dance, twirling,<br>
	Dizzying the eyes.<br>
	Translucent lollies,<br>
	Every shape, size, and vibrant color:<br>
	Oranges, lime green, grape purple.<br>
	A chocolate fountain gurgles<br>
	And oozes inviting warmth.<br>
	<br>
	Wind cuts to my bones.<br>
	My hand grows numb on the glass,<br>
	fogged from my breath.<br>
	<br>
	Why won’t they let me in?<br>
	<br>
	I walked many miles<br>
	Only to feast eyes<br>
	And nothing more.<br>
	Souls wore from my shoes,<br>
	Feet now bleeding,<br>
	Toes turning black.<br>
	<br>
	Then I make the endless journey back home.<br>
	That’s when irony strikes:<br>
	There’s a candy store just across my street,<br>
	Doors wide open.<br>
	My eyes water as the candy-man beckons.<br>

	<h4>Dragon Within</h4>
	In twilight, I die,<br>
	In dawn, I’m born.<br>
	I die again,<br>
	I’m born again.<br>
	But something lingers,<br>
	It lives through it all.<br>
	<br>
	Buried in the chambers,<br>
	Hidden somewhere in windy caverns,<br>
	A dragon from hell slumbers.<br>
	<br>
	A harp plays a lullaby<br>
	To keep the beast in remission.<br>
	The music must never stop.<br>
	Never!<br>
	<br>
	In dawn, I’m born.<br>
	I renew the melody,<br>
	Until the day comes<br>
	That in its sleep, the dragon<br>
	Dies.<br>

	<h4>Masochism</h4>
	To be masochistic is human.
	What wicked inflictors we are<br>
	Of our worst pains.<br>
	Ravening wolves to our own flesh,<br>
	Relentless taskmasters, lashing,<br>
	Fury surpassing an angry drunk.<br>
	<br>
	Day after day, we add to our weight<br>
	By chains lengthened link by link.<br>
	The key’s well within our grasp,<br>
	But across an endless chasm<br>
	Dug by pride.<br>
	<br>
	Stab the drill in your ear and scream,<br>
	“Oh wretched dissonant sound!<br>
	Of the song of redeeming love<br>
	I swear I don’t deserve to hear.”<br>

	<h3>After sunset, the Y hike inspired me to write the following</h3>
	
	<h4>Upside Down World</h4>
	The stars are on the ground,<br>
	Mostly yellow and white,<br>
	But interspersed with red and green.<br>
	Some lights move and blink.<br>
	It radiates in such a blaze<br>
	As to give light to my mountain trail<br>
	As I gaze down below.<br>
	<br>
	Only a few specs above shine,<br>
	Through the misty sky.<br>
	So correct me if I’m wrong,<br>
	But aren’t the stars suppose<br>
	To be in the sky?<br>

<h2>Divine Grace</h2>

	<h4>Angels Are Here</h4>
	The bitter cold burns us to our bones,<br>
	<span class="tab">But angels are here.</span><br>
	We drag heavy loads across endless wilderness,<br>
	<span class="tab">But angels are here.</span><br>
	Our feet bleed, we walk on numbing ice,<br>
	<span class="tab">But angels are here.</span><br>
	We face blinding blizzards, relentless winds,<br>
	<span class="tab">But angels are here.</span><br>
	<br>
	Strength is failing,<br>
	Hell wants to consume us,<br>
	Darkness gathers to every corner,<br>
	We want death to end it,<br>
	We can’t persevere!<br>
	<span class="tab">But angels run,</span><br>
	<span class="tab">Flaming chariots fly to our aid.</span><br>
	<span class="tab">Faith, my friend, angels are here.</span><br>

	<h4>Broken Heart</h4>
	Every tear shed<br>
	For the grief of sin<br>
	Is a diamond,<br>
	Oozing from the soul,<br>
	Manifesting the beauty<br>
	Beneath the stone surface.<br>

	<h4>Do I Proceed?</h4>
	I’m a dog, soaking in the rain,<br>
	So my Master opens the door<br>
	That I may come in from the cold.<br>
	But do I proceed?<br>
	<br>
	As I hesitate, He says,<br>
	“Come in child or you’ll be ill.”<br>
	But do I proceed?<br>
	Do I open my door to let Him in?<br>
	But how do I proceed?<br>
	<br>
	Progression is integrated fire,<br>
	Fire is integrated love.<br>
	This is my algorithm<br>
	And a lifetime it will last.<br>

	<h4>Eyes</h4>
	I close my eyes to open them in spirit,<br>
	anticipating windows of heaven breaking,<br>
	realizing–they already have?<br>

	<h4>Phone Call to God</h4>
	I dial 9-1-1<br>
	To speak to Father above,<br>
	And say, “My spirit is dying.<br>
	Wilt Thou revive me…<br>
	<br>
	Again?<br>
	<br>
	I’m losing too much blood,<br>
	So I need Thy Son’s<br>
	Transfusion.”<br>

	<h4>Seam Ripper</h4>
	Various colors, shapes, patterns<br>
	We sow together.<br>
	A dream we strive to make of life,<br>
	A dream so perfect.<br>
	<br>
	But sabotage by our follied hands,<br>
	Pieces sown on backward,<br>
	Or wrongly arranged, ruins.<br>
	<br>
	Stitches crooked,<br>
	Woefully past the seam allowance.<br>
	Nothing can match,<br>
	No matter how we stretch it to fit.<br>
	<br>
	We cry in bitterness,<br>
	At the abomination live’s become.<br>
	So ugly! So ugly!<br>
	<br>
	But then the Teacher comes,<br>
	Places wounded hand on our shoulder,<br>
	Reassuring us.<br>
	<br>
	The Teacher takes from our hands,<br>
	The crooked square,<br>
	And says, “I’ll fix this,<br>
	Continue to sew the others.<br>
	All I ask is that you keep learning.”<br>
	<br>
	It hurts when the Teacher picks,<br>
	Ripping, tearing, yanking, breaking,<br>
	Like a lion digging in claws!<br>
	But soothing as mistakes are erased.<br>
	<br>
	We make more mistakes,<br>
	And bashfully hand them over,<br>
	And keep working in the meantime.<br>
	<br>
	When all is said and done,<br>
	In the end, we find a quilt,<br>
	More beautiful than we imagined.<br>

<h2>Support</h2>

	<h4>Mother Ship of Love</h4>
	It spans its wings across the room.<br>
	With laser precision, it makes the stitch<br>
	To weld geometry of technicolor.<br>
	<br>
	The end result, an object of aesthetics,<br>
	And of warmth and comfort for friends.<br>
	This is how she wraps them in her loving arms.<br>

	<h4>Partnership</h4>
	We speak on the phone each night;<br>
	One’s the joker, one’s the thief.<br>
	The roles interchange,<br>
	But oh so very real.<br>
	<br>
	Working together, hand in hand,<br>
	We seek behind the sheetrock<br>
	A steady place to hammer in a nail.<br>
	<br>
	As rock climbers work two by two,<br>
	The one higher lifts up the other.<br>
	Bruised, scratched, broken<br>
	From our many falls,<br>
	But the ascent continues.<br>
	<br>
	At our destination,<br>
	We’ll enter our rest.<br>
	Slip off our shoes.<br>
	For we’ll stand on sacred ground,<br>
	But for now, the hour is getting late.<br>

	<h4>Worthiness</h4>
	The old wise eagle listened<br>
	As the young fledging said,<br>
	“I did a stupid thing and listened<br>
	To what the garden snake said.<br>
	<br>
	“He told me with slithering tongue,<br>
	‘Drop bricks on your wing,<br>
	It’ll be so much fun.’<br>
	When I did, it sure did sting.”<br>
	<br>
	The eagle looked and pitied.<br>
	He said, “Yes, stupid indeed,<br>
	But we all make mistakes.<br>
	Must not listen to slithering snakes.”<br>
	<br>
	The young one glanced up with a sigh,<br>
	“Do I still have permission to fly?”<br>
	<br>
	The old eagle sorrowed and said,<br>
	“One thing to stuff in your head,<br>
	It’s not that you may not,<br>
	Rather you simple cannot;<br>
	Not with broken wings.<br>
	<br>
	“You see, when you pick up things<br>
	You pick up both the ends.<br>
	But soon you’ll fly again, promise,<br>
	In due time when the wing mends.<br>
	<br>
	“But one thing you must promise,<br>
	Promise me this for heaven’s sake,<br>
	Don’t go listening to garden snakes.”<br>

	<h4>Leila</h4>
	I got a girlfriend<br>
	With four padded feet.<br>
	She was homeless,<br>
	Found on busy streets.<br>
	Where’d she come from?<br>
	She fell from the sky,<br>
	But beyond that<br>
	Nobody knows.<br>
	She never sheds,<br>
	Just spreads fibers of love.<br>
	Alright, fine I’ll admit it,<br>
	She sheds, she sheds!<br>
	But perfect still.<br>
	She wasn’t the one rescued,<br>
	But rather it was me.<br>

<h2>Political</h2>

	<h4>Christmas Season</h4>
	Christmas is salt to flavor the world,<br>
	Oh how delicious is the season!<br>
	<br>
	But what good is salt that lost its savor,<br>
	But to be trodden upon,<br>
	Or to become a jingling bell<br>
	That lost its melodic sound?<br>
	<br>
	The Grinch may not steal Christmas,<br>
	But perhaps a politician can?<br>

	<h4>Almighty Scapegoat</h4>
	All hail the Almighty Scapegoat,<br>
	The Great Deity of convenient untruth!<br>
	<br>
	After all, junior just committed suicide, but why?<br>
	Was it pressure from school or home?<br>
	Perhaps loneliness, bullying, or divorced parent maybe?<br>
	Oh come on, don’t be daft!<br>
	<br>
	We all know what happened to poor junior.<br>
	It was the Almighty Scapegoat, of course!<br>
	Those blasted games of Dungeon and Dragons done him in.<br>
	That blasted heavy metal, since tight leather pants can’t be right.<br>
	Neither can the witchcraft and wizardry of Harry Potter be right.<br>
	Or was it too much gluten in his diet?<br>
	Or elves? I hate those guys!<br>
	<br>
	Whatever we do, let’s not keep it real.<br>
	Who wants to be uncomfortable.<br>

	<h4>Woke Haiku</h4>
	To be woke is to<br>
	be whipped, as opposed to be<br>
	awake, so wake up!<br>

<h2>Rising Up</h2>

	<h4>Elephant</h4>
	Mind if we discuss the elephant in the room?<br>
	Let’s do so before it<br>
	<span class="tab">Stomps through our couches,</span><br>
	<span class="tab">Knocks over lamps,</span><br>
	<span class="tab">Shatters fine china,</span><br>
	<span class="tab">Drinks from the toilet, splashing water about,</span><br>
	<span class="tab">Plows through walls,</span><br>
	<span class="tab">Sounds its trumpet,</span><br>
	<span class="tab">And provokes the neighbors to call the police.</span><br>
	We need a solution–now!<br>

	<h4>Lyric of the Phoenix</h4>
	The gun smoke leaves your barrel,<br>
	I feel the bullet burn through my heart.<br>
	Blood drips down the front of my coat;<br>
	Thanks to you, I’m a ghost.<br>
	I now have the chance to show you<br>
	I’ll be the ghost with the most.<br>
	You can’t hear me, you can’t see me,<br>
	But I’ll haunt you from the dust.<br>
	<br>
	I burn my bridges behind me,<br>
	Let them go up in flames,<br>
	Let them crumble into the abyss.<br>
	<br>
	All the hate, the bitterness,<br>
	All the guilt, the self pity,<br>
	All the betrayal, the lies,<br>
	All the druggy numbness<br>
	Substituted for peace,<br>
	All desires for self destruction…<br>
	<br>
	Let it burn, let it all burn.<br>
	Purge the past from every inch of hell,<br>
	Let it crumble into the abyss.<br>
	<br>
	Then the ashes, I spread across the ground<br>
	Makes the soil rich and fertile.<br>
	Oh what eternal garden shall grow.<br>
	<br>
	A Phoenix rises from the ashes.<br>
	She outstretches wings of fire,<br>
	Soaring over mountain peaks,<br>
	Singing a song, quiet but sharp,<br>
	“I am free, I am free,<br>
	So soar the skies with me.”<br>

	<h4>Freight Train</h4>
	There’s blood on my knees from crawling,<br>
	But I won’t stop crawling.<br>
	There’s broken, bruised rib cages,<br>
	But I won’t stop breathing.<br>
	A sledge hammer bashed my skull repeatedly,<br>
	But I won’t stop remaining awake.<br>
	I scream, fight, and rise like a benevolent dictator.<br>
	Do you want my life?<br>
	You must take it from my cold, dead fingers.<br>
	Otherwise, I’ll never stop.<br>

<h2>Angst</h2>

	<h4>S. A. D.</h4>
	Farewell, February,<br>
	And good riddance<br>
	To freezing in the hell<br>
	Of groundhog shadow.<br>
	<br>
	Bring on spring<br>
	To thaw my stone heart,<br>
	And turn it Irish green.<br>

	<h4>Weak Wordplay<br>
		<span style="color: red">
			<em>Warning: The sarcasm of the following poem is not for the faint of heart.</em>
		</span>
	</h4>
	“I hate your wordplay,<br>
	WFT? It’s da gay,”<br>
	Is what my critics say.<br>
	<br>
	Wanna eat some hay?<br>
	Down by the bay?<br>
	Doesn’t this poetry…suck?<br>
	Ooops! Doesn’t rhyme.<br>
	Neither does suck.<br>
	<br>
	Now we’re getting dumber<br>
	From da weak wordplay.<br>
	<br>
	Blam!<br>

	<h4>Drowned Out</h4>
	A bloodied hand slaps the window<br>
	As something in my soul screams,<br>
	“Please! Let me out, Let me out!<br>
	Don’t let me suffocate in here!”<br>
	Around me, conversations shift.<br>
	I thought I knew what everyone<br>
	Was talking about, but now wrong.<br>
	They talk circles and circles<br>
	Around what I wish I could say.<br>
	My voice drowned out by a flood.<br>
	I’m suffocating, drowning,<br>
	Sinking ever downward,<br>
	As currents tumble me about.<br>
	Arms and legs fling in panic.<br>
	Ironically, they think<br>
	I don’t have much to say.<br>

	<h4>Thus spake the former gods of Deprecca:</h4>
	Blacken the skies with death,<br>
	Scourge the earth sour,<br>
	Turn our backs on the mortals,<br>
	Bleed their ears, break their knees.<br>
	Worse of all, shatter the crystal.<br>
	<br>
	We're not the ones who've abandoned,<br>
	Rather, these <em>warmongers</em> brought on their own...<br>
	<br>
	<em>Deprecation.</em><br>
