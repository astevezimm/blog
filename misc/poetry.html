Self Reflection

	{{render_heading("Acted Upon", 2, True, 0)}}
	I open myself, so the door can enter in.<br>
	It has a keyhole in the shape of a key.<br>
	<br>
	I go home, let my shoes kick me off<br>
	That I may allow my couch to rest,<br>
	Then talk relentlessly to the TV.<br>
	<br>
	But wait, what is that noise?<br>
	The fridge growls at my stomach,<br>
	So I allow it to eat me;<br>
	I am a tasty snack.<br>
	<br>
	The couch returns,<br>
	The TV continues to stare.<br>
	For the rest of the evening,<br>
	The hands on the clock spin me around.<br>
	<br>

	<h2>Caterpillar</h2>
	The caterpillar has an insatiable appetite,<br>
	An alimentary canal that crawls,<br>
	Eating the wings of the butterfly in my hand<br>
	<br>
	As it says, “Pay no attention to what you see.<br>
	For I’ll be a bigger, better butterfly.”<br>
	<br>
	I know it’s lying, but I stand paralyzed<br>
	And the lactic acid burns.<br>
	<br>
	A tumor expands which I pretend<br>
	Is just another appendage.<br>
	<br>
	In the meantime,<br>
	Not a thread of a cocoon is made.<br>
	The caterpillar eats, eats, eats,<br>
	And pacifies with lies.<br>

	{{render_heading("Candy Store", 2, True, 2)}}
	I’m but a lad.<br>
	I press my hand against the glass,<br>
	Peering into the candy store.<br>
	<br>
	Red and white peppermint ribbons<br>
	Do their dance, twirling,<br>
	Dizzying the eyes.<br>
	Translucent lollies,<br>
	Every shape, size, and vibrant color:<br>
	Oranges, lime green, grape purple.<br>
	A chocolate fountain gurgles<br>
	And oozes inviting warmth.<br>
	<br>
	Wind cuts to my bones.<br>
	My hand grows numb on the glass,<br>
	fogged from my breath.<br>
	<br>
	Why won’t they let me in?<br>
	<br>
	I walked many miles<br>
	Only to feast eyes<br>
	And nothing more.<br>
	Souls wore from my shoes,<br>
	Feet now bleeding,<br>
	Toes turning black.<br>
	<br>
	Then I make the endless journey back home.<br>
	That’s when irony strikes:<br>
	There’s a candy store just across my street,<br>
	Doors wide open.<br>
	My eyes water as the candy-man beckons.<br>

	<h2>Dragon Within</h2>
	In twilight, I die,<br>
	In dawn, I’m born.<br>
	I die again,<br>
	I’m born again.<br>
	But something lingers,<br>
	It lives through it all.<br>
	<br>
	Buried in the chambers,<br>
	Hidden somewhere in windy caverns,<br>
	A dragon from hell slumbers.<br>
	<br>
	A harp plays a lullaby<br>
	To keep the beast in remission.<br>
	The music must never stop.<br>
	Never!<br>
	<br>
	In dawn, I’m born.<br>
	I renew the melody,<br>
	Until the day comes<br>
	That in its sleep, the dragon<br>
	Dies.<br>

	{{render_heading("Masochism", 2, True, 6)}}
	To be masochistic is human.
	What wicked inflictors we are<br>
	Of our worst pains.<br>
	Ravening wolves to our own flesh,<br>
	Relentless taskmasters, lashing,<br>
	Fury surpassing an angry drunk.<br>
	<br>
	Day after day, we add to our weight<br>
	By chains lengthened link by link.<br>
	The key’s well within our grasp,<br>
	But across an endless chasm<br>
	Dug by pride.<br>
	<br>
	Stab the drill in your ear and scream,<br>
	“Oh wretched dissonant sound!<br>
	Of the song of redeeming love<br>
	I swear I don’t deserve to hear.”<br>

Divine Grace

	<h2>Angels Are Here</h2>
	The bitter cold burns us to our bones,<br>
	<span class="tab">But angels are here.</span><br>
	We drag heavy loads across endless wilderness,<br>
	<span class="tab">But angels are here.</span><br>
	Our feet bleed, we walk on numbing ice,<br>
	<span class="tab">But angels are here.</span><br>
	We face blinding blizzards, relentless winds,<br>
	<span class="tab">But angels are here.</span><br>
	<br>
	Strength is failing,<br>
	Hell wants to consume us,<br>
	Darkness gathers to every corner,<br>
	We want death to end it,<br>
	We can’t persevere!<br>
	<span class="tab">But angels run,</span><br>
	<span class="tab">Flaming chariots fly to our aid.</span><br>
	<span class="tab">Faith, my friend, angels are here.</span><br>

	{{render_heading("Broken Heart", 2, True, 1)}}
	Every tear shed<br>
	For the grief of sin<br>
	Is a diamond,<br>
	Oozing from the soul,<br>
	Manifesting the beauty<br>
	Beneath the stone surface.<br>

	{{render_heading("Do I Proceed?", 2, True, 3)}}
	I’m a dog, soaking in the rain,<br>
	So my Master opens the door<br>
	That I may come in from the cold.<br>
	But do I proceed?<br>
	<br>
	As I hesitate, He says,<br>
	“Come in child or you’ll be ill.”<br>
	But do I proceed?<br>
	Do I open my door to let Him in?<br>
	But how do I proceed?<br>
	<br>
	Progression is integrated fire,<br>
	Fire is integrated love.<br>
	This is my algorithm<br>
	And a lifetime it will last.<br>

	<h2>Eyes</h2>
	I close my eyes to open them in spirit,<br>
	anticipating windows of heaven breaking,<br>
	realizing–they already have?<br>

	<h2>Phone Call to God</h2>
	I dial 9-1-1<br>
	To speak to Father above,<br>
	And say, “My spirit is dying.<br>
	Wilt Thou revive me…<br>
	<br>
	Again?<br>
	<br>
	I’m losing too much blood,<br>
	So I need Thy Son’s<br>
	Transfusion.”<br>

	<h2>Seam Ripper</h2>
	Various colors, shapes, patterns<br>
	We sow together.<br>
	A dream we strive to make of life,<br>
	A dream so perfect.<br>
	<br>
	But sabotage by our follied hands,<br>
	Pieces sown on backward,<br>
	Or wrongly arranged, ruins.<br>
	<br>
	Stitches crooked,<br>
	Woefully past the seam allowance.<br>
	Nothing can match,<br>
	No matter how we stretch it to fit.<br>
	<br>
	We cry in bitterness,<br>
	At the abomination live’s become.<br>
	So ugly! So ugly!<br>
	<br>
	But then the Teacher comes,<br>
	Places wounded hand on our shoulder,<br>
	Reassuring us.<br>
	<br>
	The Teacher takes from our hands,<br>
	The crooked square,<br>
	And says, “I’ll fix this,<br>
	Continue to sew the others.<br>
	All I ask is that you keep learning.”<br>
	<br>
	It hurts when the Teacher picks,<br>
	Ripping, tearing, yanking, breaking,<br>
	Like a lion digging in claws!<br>
	But soothing as mistakes are erased.<br>
	<br>
	We make more mistakes,<br>
	And bashfully hand them over,<br>
	And keep working in the meantime.<br>
	<br>
	When all is said and done,<br>
	In the end, we find a quilt,<br>
	More beautiful than we imagined.<br>

	<h2>Mother Ship of Love</h2>
	It spans its wings across the room.<br>
	With laser precision, it makes the stitch<br>
	To weld geometry of technicolor.<br>
	<br>
	The end result, an object of aesthetics,<br>
	And of warmth and comfort for friends.<br>
	This is how she wraps them in her loving arms.<br>

	{{render_heading("Partnership", 2, True, 7)}}
	We speak on the phone each night;<br>
	One’s the joker, one’s the thief.<br>
	The roles interchange,<br>
	But oh so very real.<br>
	<br>
	Working together, hand in hand,<br>
	We seek behind the sheetrock<br>
	A steady place to hammer in a nail.<br>
	<br>
	As rock climbers work two by two,<br>
	The one higher lifts up the other.<br>
	Bruised, scratched, broken<br>
	From our many falls,<br>
	But the ascent continues.<br>
	<br>
	At our destination,<br>
	We’ll enter our rest.<br>
	Slip off our shoes.<br>
	For we’ll stand on sacred ground,<br>
	But for now, the hour is getting late.<br>

	<h2>Worthiness</h2>
	The old wise eagle listened<br>
	As the young fledging said,<br>
	“I did a stupid thing and listened<br>
	To what the garden snake said.<br>
	<br>
	“He told me with slithering tongue,<br>
	‘Drop bricks on your wing,<br>
	It’ll be so much fun.’<br>
	When I did, it sure did sting.”<br>
	<br>
	The eagle looked and pitied.<br>
	He said, “Yes, stupid indeed,<br>
	But we all make mistakes.<br>
	Must not listen to slithering snakes.”<br>
	<br>
	The young one glanced up with a sigh,<br>
	“Do I still have permission to fly?”<br>
	<br>
	The old eagle sorrowed and said,<br>
	“One thing to stuff in your head,<br>
	It’s not that you may not,<br>
	Rather you simple cannot;<br>
	Not with broken wings.<br>
	<br>
	“You see, when you pick up things<br>
	You pick up both the ends.<br>
	But soon you’ll fly again, promise,<br>
	In due time when the wing mends.<br>
	<br>
	“But one thing you must promise,<br>
	Promise me this for heaven’s sake,<br>
	Don’t go listening to garden snakes.”<br>

	Leila
	I got a girlfriend
	With four padded feet.
	She was homeless,
	Found on busy streets.
	Where’d she come from?
	She fell from the sky,
	But beyond that
	Nobody knows.
	She never sheds,
	Just spreads fibers of love.
	Alright, fine I’ll admit it,
	She sheds, she sheds!
	But perfect still.
	She wasn’t the one rescued,
	But rather it was me.

Political

	<h2>Christmas Season</h2>
	Christmas is salt to flavor the world,<br>
	Oh how delicious is the season!<br>
	<br>
	But what good is salt that lost its savor,<br>
	But to be trodden upon,<br>
	Or to become a jingling bell<br>
	That lost its melodic sound?<br>
	<br>
	The Grinch may not steal Christmas,<br>
	But perhaps a politician can?<br>

	Almighty Scapegoat
	All hail the Almighty Scapegoat,
	The Great Deity of convenient untruth!
	<br>
	After all, junior just committed suicide, but why?
	Was it pressure from school or home?
	Perhaps loneliness, bullying, or divorced parent maybe?
	Oh come on, don’t be daft!
	<br>
	We all know what happened to poor junior.
	It was the Almighty Scapegoat, of course!
	Those blasted games of Dungeon and Dragons done him in.
	That blasted heavy metal, since tight leather pants can’t be right.
	Neither can the witchcraft and wizardry of Harry Potter be right.
	Or was it too much gluten in his diet?
	Or elves? I hate those guys!
	<br>
	Whatever we do, let’s not keep it real.
	Who wants to be uncomfortable.

	Woke Haiku
	To be woke is to
	be whipped, as opposed to be
	awake, so wake up!

	I’ll be the ghost with the most.<br>
	You can’t hear me, you can’t see me,<br>

	Soaring over mountain peaks,<br>
	Singing a song, quiet but sharp,<br>
	“I am free, I am free,<br>
	So soar the skies with me.”<br>

	Freight Train
	There’s blood on my knees from crawling,
	But I won’t stop crawling.
	There’s broken, bruised rib cages,
	But I won’t stop breathing.
	A sledge hammer bashed my skull repeatedly,
	But I won’t stop remaining awake.
	I scream, fight, and rise like a benevolent dictator.
	Do you want my life?
	You must take it from my cold, dead fingers.
	Otherwise, I’ll never stop.

	Drowned Out
	A bloodied hand slaps the window
	As something in my soul screams,
	“Please! Let me out, Let me out!
	Don’t let me suffocate in here!”
	Around me, conversations shift.
	I thought I knew what everyone
	Was talking about, but now wrong.
	They talk circles and circles
	Around what I wish I could say.
	My voice drowned out by a flood.
	I’m suffocating, drowning,
	Sinking ever downward,
	As currents tumble me about.
	Arms and legs fling in panic.
	Ironically, they think
	I don’t have much to say.



After sunset, the Y hike inspired me to write the following

Upside Down World
The stars are on the ground,
Mostly yellow and white,
But interspersed with red and green.
Some lights move and blink.
It radiates in such a blaze
As to give light to my mountain trail
As I gaze down below.

Only a few specs above shine,
Through the misty sky.
So correct me if I’m wrong,
But aren’t the stars suppose
To be in the sky?



Thus spake the former gods of Deprecca:

Blacken the skies with death,
Scourge the earth sour,
Turn our backs on the mortals,
Bleed their ears, break their knees.
Worse of all, shatter the crystal.

We're not the ones who've abandoned,
Rather, these <em>warmongers</em> brought on their own...

	Deprecation.
