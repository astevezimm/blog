		<h4>S. A. D.</h4>
		Farewell, February,<br>
		And good riddance<br>

		“I hate your wordplay,<br>
		WFT? It’s da gay,”<br>
		Is what my critics say.<br>
		<br>
		Wanna eat some hay?<br>
		Down by the bay?<br>
		Doesn’t this poetry…suck?<br>
		Ooops! Doesn’t rhyme.<br>
		Neither does suck.<br>

		<h4>Drowned Out</h4>
		A bloodied hand slaps the window<br>
		As something in my soul screams,<br>
		“Please! Let me out, Let me out!<br>
		Don’t let me suffocate in here!”<br>
		Around me, conversations shift.<br>
		I thought I knew what everyone<br>
		Was talking about, but now wrong.<br>
		They talk circles and circles<br>
		Around what I wish I could say.<br>
		My voice drowned out by a flood.<br>
		I’m suffocating, drowning,<br>
		Sinking ever downward,<br>
		As currents tumble me about.<br>
		Arms and legs fling in panic.<br>
		Ironically, they think<br>
		I don’t have much to say.<br>
	</div>

	<div class=\"col-md-6\">
		<h4>Thus spake the former gods of Deprecca:</h4>
		Blacken the skies with death,<br>
		Scourge the earth sour,<br>
		Turn our backs on the mortals,<br>
		Bleed their ears, break their knees.<br>
		Worse of all, shatter the crystal.<br>
		<br>
		We're not the ones who've abandoned,<br>
		Rather, these <em>warmongers</em> brought on their own...<br>
		<br>
		<em>Deprecation.</em><br>

<div class=\"col-md-6\">
	<h4>Mother Ship of Love</h4>
	It spans its wings across the room.<br>
	With laser precision, it makes the stitch<br>
	To weld geometry of technicolor.<br>
	<br>
	The end result, an object of aesthetics,<br>
	And of warmth and comfort for friends.<br>
	This is how she wraps them in her loving arms.<br>
</div>

<div class=\"col-md-6\">
	<h4>Partnership</h4>
	We speak on the phone each night;<br>
	One’s the joker, one’s the thief.<br>
	The roles interchange,<br>
	But oh so very real.<br>
	<br>
	Working together, hand in hand,<br>
	We seek behind the sheetrock<br>
	A steady place to hammer in a nail.<br>
	<br>
	As rock climbers work two by two,<br>
	The one higher lifts up the other.<br>
	Bruised, scratched, broken<br>
	From our many falls,<br>
	But the ascent continues.<br>
	<br>
	At our destination,<br>
	We’ll enter our rest.<br>
	Slip off our shoes.<br>
	For we’ll stand on sacred ground,<br>
	But for now, the hour is getting late.<br>
</div>

	<h4>Worthiness</h4>
	The old wise eagle listened<br>
	As the young fledging said,<br>
	“I did a stupid thing and listened<br>
	To what the garden snake said.<br>
	<br>
	“He told me with slithering tongue,<br>
	‘Drop bricks on your wing,<br>
	It’ll be so much fun.’<br>
	When I did, it sure did sting.”<br>
	<br>
	The eagle looked and pitied.<br>
	He said, “Yes, stupid indeed,<br>
	But we all make mistakes.<br>
	Must not listen to slithering snakes.”<br>
	<br>
	The young one glanced up with a sigh,<br>
	“Do I still have permission to fly?”<br>
	<br>
	The old eagle sorrowed and said,<br>
	“One thing to stuff in your head,<br>
	It’s not that you may not,<br>
	Rather you simple cannot;<br>
	Not with broken wings.<br>
	<br>
	“You see, when you pick up things<br>
	You pick up both the ends.<br>
	But soon you’ll fly again, promise,<br>
	In due time when the wing mends.<br>
	<br>
	“But one thing you must promise,<br>
	Promise me this for heaven’s sake,<br>
	Don’t go listening to garden snakes.”<br>

	<h4>Leila</h4>
	I got a girlfriend<br>
	With four padded feet.<br>
	She was homeless,<br>
	Found on busy streets.<br>
	Where’d she come from?<br>
	She fell from the sky,<br>
	But beyond that<br>
	Nobody knows.<br>
	She never sheds,<br>
	Just spreads fibers of love.<br>
	Alright, fine I’ll admit it,<br>
	She sheds, she sheds!<br>
	But perfect still.<br>
	She wasn’t the one rescued,<br>
	But rather it was me.<br>

	<h4>Christmas Season</h4>
	Christmas is salt to flavor the world,<br>
	Oh how delicious is the season!<br>
	<br>
	But what good is salt that lost its savor,<br>
	But to be trodden upon,<br>
	Or to become a jingling bell<br>

	All hail the Almighty Scapegoat,<br>
	The Great Deity of convenient untruth!<br>
	<br>
	After all, junior just committed suicide, but why?<br>
	Was it pressure from school or home?<br>
	Perhaps loneliness, bullying, or divorced parent maybe?<br>
	Oh come on, don’t be daft!<br>
	<br>
	We all know what happened to poor junior.<br>
	It was the Almighty Scapegoat, of course!<br>
	Those blasted games of Dungeon and Dragons done him in.<br>
	That blasted heavy metal, since tight leather pants can’t be right.<br>
	Neither can the witchcraft and wizardry of Harry Potter be right.<br>
	Or was it too much gluten in his diet?<br>
	Or elves? I hate those guys!<br>

	Whatever we do, let’s not keep it real.<br>

	<h4>Lyric of the Phoenix</h4>
	The gun smoke leaves your barrel,<br>
	I feel the bullet burn through my heart.<br>
	Blood drips down the front of my coat;<br>
	Thanks to you, I’m a ghost.<br>
	I now have the chance to show you<br>
	I’ll be the ghost with the most.<br>
	You can’t hear me, you can’t see me,<br>
	But I’ll haunt you from the dust.<br>
	<br>
	I burn my bridges behind me,<br>
	Let them go up in flames,<br>
	Let them crumble into the abyss.<br>
	<br>
	All the hate, the bitterness,<br>
	All the guilt, the self pity,<br>
	All the betrayal, the lies,<br>
	All the druggy numbness<br>
	Substituted for peace,<br>
	All desires for self destruction…<br>
	<br>
	Let it burn, let it all burn.<br>
	Purge the past from every inch of hell,<br>
	Let it crumble into the abyss.<br>
	<br>
	Then the ashes, I spread across the ground<br>
	Makes the soil rich and fertile.<br>
	Oh what eternal garden shall grow.<br>
	<br>
	A Phoenix rises from the ashes.<br>
	She outstretches wings of fire,<br>
	Soaring over mountain peaks,<br>
	Singing a song, quiet but sharp,<br>
	“I am free, I am free,<br>
	So soar the skies with me.”<br>

<div class=\"col-md-6\">
	<h4>Freight Train</h4>
	There’s blood on my knees from crawling,<br>
	But I won’t stop crawling.<br>
	There’s broken, bruised rib cages,<br>
	But I won’t stop breathing.<br>
	A sledge hammer bashed my skull repeatedly,<br>
	But I won’t stop remaining awake.<br>
	I scream, fight, and rise like a benevolent dictator.<br>
	Do you want my life?<br>
	You must take it from my cold, dead fingers.<br>
	Otherwise, I’ll never stop.<br>
