Is it a giant and green clumsy ogre with a flattop, scars, bolts in the neck, and arms in front of him as he walks. If so, then I hate to break to you, but pop culture has you completely brainwashed.<br><br>First off, the name Frankenstein doesn't even refer to the monster in the first place. Victor Frankenstein is the name of the obsessed scientist who created the monster. The monster himself never has a name, because after Victor creates it and regrets the deed, he views it as an abomination that deserves no name.<br><br>Maybe you already 
know all of this as one of the more informed people on the subject. I bet, however, that if you're like me, you still slip up even though you know better. Around Halloween time, when you see a decoration of everybody's favorite green man stuck to some window, the name 
that comes to mind is Frankenstein proving how deep the brainwashing goes.<br><br>Unfortunately, this isn't the worst part. We are all victims to Hollywood in a far more nefarious way. I came to appreciate this after recently reading the original novel from the original imagination, Mary Shelly, who first conceived of the creature. I can, therefore, attest to the fact that the blubbering green ogre so familiar in pop culture has no accuracy by any stretch of the imagination to the monster that Mary Shelley imagined.<br><br>The book 
is vague on the details of how Frankenstein constructed his monster. It, however, seems clear from the available description that he built the monster from scratch, not from corpses sown together like in how the story is traditionally depicted. The reason Frankenstein 
made his creation large was to make construction easier of the smaller organs. The end result of Victor Frankenstein's work was something large with transparent yellow skin that possessed super human strength and speed. He was an intelligent creature who became literate over time and used smart stratagem in inflicting his vengeance on Victor.<br><br>Wouldn't you agree that this notion of the monster is far more compelling than the dorky Halloween decorations? I believe it all started with the 1931 Frankenstein movie followed by the 
sequel Bride of Frankenstein who is actually the bride of the monster not the creator. This just might be the most brutal butchering in which Hollywood is guilty.<br><br>Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, there are no accurate depictions of the story. No, not even the 1994 movie entitled, Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. It's closer than most, but sorry, no cigar.", "url" : "hollywoods-murder-in-cold-blood" }

I took off my headphones to take a break from my music to hear a coworker shout out, \"How can you not like the Muppets? It's like not liking joy and happiness!\" Gotta love the randomness of conversations that happen around the office.<br><br>I'd have to agree, however. The Muppets are awesome. It's impossible to see the performances of the various and diverse characters, which are many, and not be delighted by them. The Jim Hansen company is talented.<br><br>So if you were to ask what my favorite Christmas movie is, the one that has always resonated with me since it came out back in the nineties is Muppet Christmas Carol. This movie has the silliness and fun of the Muppets combined with a well executed and remarkably accurate telling of Charles Dickens classic.<br><!-- BREAK POINT --><br>For the past few years, this proved to be a frustratingly difficult one to find as I've looked everywhere, including on Netflix, Redbox, and what have you. So it feels like a Christmas miracle to have it recently released on Blu ray. On my next trip to Costco I said, \"Shut up and take my money!\" And of course, I'm not endorsing anything with all this.<br><br>It was interesting to see the feature on the Blu ray where Gonzo and Rizzo the rat interviews Brian Hansen who became President of Jim Hansen after the passing of his father. Muppet Christmas Carol was the first Muppet movie they created in this new era of the company.<br><br>When they first proposed the concept of a Muppet version of the Christmas Carol, they had a lot of doubt as to how well the story could translate into a Muppet movie, but still threw around ideas of what Muppets could play what roles in the stories.<br><br>They proposed that Gonzo could be the ghost of Christmas future. As funny as it would be to see Gonzo's nose sticking out of the cloak, I'm glad they didn't go that direction.<br><br>It worked well to have newly created puppets play the three ghosts in keeping with the spirit, integrity, and emotional impact of the original story. Speaking of which, I always thought that the ghost of Christmas past was CGI, but no, it isn't. It's an actually 
puppet that they filmed in a tank of water. Then, I don't exactly know how, perhaps through green screen effects, they superimposed her into the scenes and gave her the glowing effect. She, by the way, is the creepiest thing to come out of Jim Hansen's Studio, I think.<br><br>Anyway, it all came together for them, after it occurred to them to cast Gonzo as Charles Dickens, narrating the story into a film I will always treasure and perhaps pass on to my children, grand children, and so forth. Of course, that's after I have success in getting those blasted wedding bells to ring for me, but I'll dispense in opening that can of worms in my blog for the time being.<br><br>In the meantime, the Muppets rock!!", "url" : "a-favorite-muppet-christmas-carol" }

One day, I came in the room as he watched one about lions and how their packs, or according to official terminology, prides function.<br><br>A pride is ruled over by a male lion, who leads them in hunting and survival. But sometimes you have other males who come into their territory and challenge them for that pride. This is a fight either to the death or until one of them surrenders, signified by laying on his back. The defeated lion has to leave and survive on his own, unless he finds another pride to overtake. The documentary followed one banished male who eventually starved to death.<br><br>Now, here's the part that's kinda messed up. The first thing that a male does after overtaking a pride is to kill the cubs. They rip the poor helpless young-lings apart with their mothers standing by, watching and accepting their little ones' fate.<br><br>After I marveled about the cruelty and brutality that exists in nature, my thoughts turned to The Lion King. That's when the light went on above my head. Cha-Ching!<br><br>The whole plot of the movie falls directly out of these facts about lions. Scar kills Mufasa to rule the pride in his place, though since he's weaker than him, the murder happens through stratagem with the hyenas. This sort of thing is typical of villains in stories.<br><br>Then, what's the first thing a male does after overtaking a pride? Kill the cubs. That's exactly what Scar does. He sends the hyenas after Simba. After Simba gets away, he becomes an outcast with no pride. See what I did there? However, with a little help from his new found friends, he's able to survive until he becomes old enough to return and challenge Scar for the pride.

People are surprised that he doesn't talk about his books, but rather he gives this presentation on things most important to him, sharing his life lessons. And boy, they are remarkable and inspiring. James Owen has truly seen adversity in his life, but has shown incredible courage, fighting in the face of them for the things he wanted most.<br><br>He had a rare blood disease in his youth that has made him allergic to just about everything and has come close to death because of it. This perspective in which our days are numbered, led him to start a comic book business in his teens and kept working at it despite all the voices telling him that he was too young.<br><br>Later, started doing more graphic design work and less comic book stuff. Then, he invested nearly everything he had for a trip to Ireland to apply for a job at an animation studio. He discovered when he arrived that the studio was going out of business, putting him in serious trouble.<br><br>He recognized this as an opportunity for a critical decision, so he returned back to what he felt he should have been doing all along, revisiting the comic book business he pursued in his youth. But in the most critical time for his business, he demolished his drawing hand 
in a car accident. Through this and other challenges, he never gave up. The success he currently has was well earned.<br><br>His message is one the is best given in his own words, so I'll quote some of his take home points:<ul><li><span style=\"line-height: 14px;\">If 
you really want to do something, no one can stop you, but if you really don't want to do something, no one can help you.</span></li><li>Live deliberately. Decide: Are you the kind of person things happen to, or the kind of person who makes thing happen?</li><li>Never, 
ever, sacrifice what you want the most, for what you want the most at that moment.</li></ul><p>At the end of his presentation, he gives a demonstration of drawing a dragon that he applies to life. He says that the key to drawing is making lines and choosing where they 
go. Every drawing, every life is nothing but a series of choices and actions. What you draw is entirely up to you. People may not understand what your doing as you place the first few lines down, but in time they'll find that you where drawing a dragon all along.<br><br>Thank you, James, for your inspiring example of how to live.", "url" : "thoughts-on-drawing-out-the-dragons" }

Just meet me upstairs after pickin yer heat.\"<br><br>A wolf howled, so Weezer ran up the steps, guns poised. He thrust the basement door open with his foot. No time to stand around for the other two idiots.<br><br>He looked around, waiting. Snarling and growling came from outside the front door and boarded up windows surrounding the house. The wolves pounded, scratched, huffed and puffed on every side. Splintering wood snapped.<br><br>A window shattered in the attic. They found a way in. Weezer held his breath and listened carefully. A wolf howled through the ceiling above his head, probably the alpha wolf. There was more clawing and scraping. Others must be entering the widow. Beads of sweat collected on Weezer's snout.<br><br>The entry to the attic dropped with the ladder. Red eyes peered out of the darkness.<br><br>As as Weazer saw the fiery glimmer of the wolve's eyes, he lit up the room with gunfire. His ears rang and his eyes watered from gun smoke.

Claws scraped and the floor creaked above his head. The wolves panted as they paced the attic. Others continued to claw and scrape at the boarded up windows, surrounding the house, but Weazer's focus was on the attic opening. \"What yer vermin waiting fer, come on.\"<br><br>One of his brothers squealed behind him and charged up the ladder.<br><br>\"Wee Wee, no!\" Weazer snorted. \"Ya gonna get killed!\"<br><br>Smacking, clawing, bashing, and breaking reverberated from the attic, followed by Wee Wee squealing, \"Weee waah yah!

from what I expected.

that the face of the talking moon was projected on, performed by Glenn Beck, narrating the story.

It truly is a real treasure with a heart of gold. Watching it made me want the soundtrack, but unfortunately, it is even more elusive than the movie itself, unless I get myself a record player.<br><br>The reason for this lack of availability of Song of the South due to racial controversy. Personally, I don't really find it all that offensive. What I find in it is uplifting messages through the entertaining brer rabbit fables that Uncle Remus tells, a wise and respectable father figure to the little boy, Johnny. The songs are so classic. Songs that people are familiar with even though they haven't seen the movie they come from.<br><br>After watching the film, I've been looking around the internet in curiosity about Song of the South. I stumbled across <a href=\"http://www.songofthesouth.net/index.php\">songofthesouth.net</a> which proved to be a goldmine of info. I'm especially impressed with their defense for the movie <a href=\"http://www.songofthesouth.net/movie/overview/defense.html\">here</a> which goes through the points of controversy one by one, arguing in favor of Walt Disney, the man himself, the visionary who brought this film to life.

So how can Disney get away with this one if they can't get away with Song of the South?<br><br>Anyway, 
back to Song of the South. Walt was inspired by the writings of Joel Chandler Harris. Joel spent a great portion of his life around slaves on the plantation, listening to their oral folklore, modified versions of stories that originated in Africa. Later on, he produced writings based on these stories narrated by a fictional character named Uncle Remus. Walt Disney was one of his greatest fans, hence the reason he made Song of the South.<br><br>After learning all this, I now have Joel Chandler Harris's work on my list of things to read.

In the past, I've pondered on a strange phenomenon in Utah and its LDS culture. Bear with me and I'll eventually get to how any of this has to do with love.<br><br>First, what is the phenomenon? Uncanny numbers of big names in Science Fiction and Fantasy come from this culture. Names like Orson Scott Card, Brandon Sanderson, Stephanie Myers, Tracy Hickman, Dave Wolverton, Brandon Mull, James Dashner, and Kevin J. Anderson. It was a Mormon who invented the primary concepts behind the force in the original Star Wars (as opposed to those apostate midichlorians). The original Battle Star Galactica of the 80's was written by a Mormon. In fact, a new Utahn indie fantasy movie studio, Arrowstorm Entertainment, is making waves among fans around the world. Their special effects are astonishing for the low budget of their films.<br><br>Signs of this phenomenon were especially prevalent last September when Salt Lake City had their very first Comic Con with a record breaking attendance. An avalanche of fans swarmed the Salt Palace which they weren't prepared for, causing the crew their to be in a disorganized panic. Not only that, but nearly half of the attendees were in costume. On average, Comic Cons only have 10% of attendees wearing costumes.<br><br>So that's the phenomenon. So what's going on here? In the past, I've formulated a few different hypotheses, tying this phenomenon to the nature of LDS theology. The LDS church teaches doctrine on epic proportions that truly capture the imagination. Doctrine, in which, I want to be careful how I discuss here, since we're talking about the particular points that have stirred the most controversy in the world, regarding our eternal destiny. But it is the most epic, most awesome thing that one could possibly imagine.<br><br>Another thought I had in the past is that the LDS church is not dogmatic, but rather encourages open mindedness of its members. It teaches to seek truth wherever truth can be found. In fact, the novel Angels and Demons was intriguing to read coming from an LDS background, having as its theme the conflict of science verses religion. From the perspective of LDS theology, there is no conflict. These are merely two approaches of seeking out the same truths.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I still believe these points are contributing factors to the phenomenon. However, I had an epiphany at church this last Sunday, during a lesson on strengthening the family, on a point that should perhaps have been the most obvious. The point is this, in the words of the promos for the LDS church, \"Family, isn't it about ... time?\"<br><br>So there it is, what love has to do with any of this. Like father like son. If you have a dad that's completely obsessed with Batman, it will rub off on the child. A family oriented culture is the very best breeding grounds for nerdom. This is not just true with parent-child relationships, but with all family relationships. For instance, I contribute many of my interests in various aspects of geek culture to the great deal of time I spent with cousins growing up.<br><br>I don't have the stats on this, but I would imagine that Salt Lake Comic Con probably had a greater ratio of kids to adults than others in the nation. You'd see a lot of families that would be dressed up for different themes. For instance, a family who's all wearing Batman costumes. Will those kids be fans for life?

We still use shovels and also what we now call \"dumb phones\". Three seashells will never replace toilet paper (for those who know that reference).

He mentions some of the problems with the conventional wisdom out there, namely that one should follow their passions and set clear objective goals with deadlines.<br><br><strong>First</strong>, the problem with following passions is that sometimes they are irrational and not really all that marketable. I think this following Scott Adams cartoon really says it all.<br><br><img src=\"http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/RV-AL786_ADAMS__DV_20131011192330.jpg\" alt=\"taxidermy beer hats\" width=\"262\" height=\"262\" /><br><br>If one thinks 
taxidermy beer hats will be a hot product, at least here in the west, they will be sorely disappointed. Now this isn't to say that passion is all together a horrible evil thing, just so long as it doesn't blind you to objectivity.<br><br>Scott Adams, however, makes the interesting point that success can lead to passion. He, for instance, didn't originally aspire to be a cartoonist, but now it's safe to say, he enjoys doing it.<br><br>What about me? Have I seen success leading to passion in my life. I think so. I've seen both ends, in fact.<br><br>Things that I was once passionate about have fizzled when they've failed to lead to success. As I've looked back in hindsight at these things, I often come to discover that they are indeed taxidermy beer hats, aka not as good of an idea as it seemed at the time.<br><br>Also, success has indeed fueled passion. Take my love for programming, for instance. This is a field notorious for people loving it or hating it, based on how seeing the works of their hands run. A working program that you wrote truly is a magical thing. Also in writing, I definitely find completing two novels, and getting two honorable mentions for short stories is encouraging.<br><br><strong>Second</strong>, the problem with the conventional wisdom on setting goals is that it's not the goals that lead to success, but rather persistent work you put toward stuff. So saying, \"I'm going to workout X number of minutes a day, eat healthier each meal, and wake up at such and such time\", all does far, far more for someone than saying, \"I'm going to lose 20 pounds by such and such date.\"<br><br>This is absolutely right. How did I complete my novels? Was it by reciting a date like a magical incantation, seeing a pen and paper dance, Harry Potter style, leading to a fully written novel when the date arrived? Clearly, no. It's all about writing X number of words a day or other writing tasks like editing, brainstorming, planning, plotting, and things like that. It's like the proverbial elephant. You can't swallow it whole, so the way to eat it is a bite at a time.<br><br><strong>Lastly</strong>, and perhaps most importantly, the path to success is filled with failure. You try and you fail. You try and you fail. Rinse. Repeat. It's like they keep telling you, you just keep on trying or like Dora says on Finding Nemo, \"Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.\" Not only that, but 
the learning and growth from failures aids in future success. Like I mentioned in a previous blog post, Yoda is dead dead wrong when he said, \"Do or do not, there is no try.\" Remember that this is a nefarious and destructive lie, so shame on him for saying it.<br><br>Scott Adams recently released a book, regarding all this called \"How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big.\"", "url" : "scott-adams-on-failure-and-success" }

The name for the panel was \"Holy Gothic Archetypes, Batman\". A grad student shared his thesis analyzing the Gothic elements of the Batman comics.<br><br>The part I found most interesting is how the history of Batman has gone 
in full circle. In the beginning, much before the Adam West days, the Batman comics were very dark and Gothic, both the bat and his villains.<br><br>Later in the 20th century, the comic book industry went through a phase where outside influence put on the pressure to make things more soft, innocent, and kid friendly. This is where you get the goofy and quirky Batman of the Adam West days and the sidekick, Robin.<br><br>Then in time, when the comic book industry, for better or worse, was given more liberty again for artistic expression, being taken more seriously as an art form, Batman returned to its dark and gothy roots. This was especially prevalent in the Batman animated series I watched growing up, intrigued by the demented and psychologically tormented villains.<br><br>But I'd to take all this a step further. Not only is Batman Gothic and was Gothic from the very beginning, but I would argue that he is Dracula himself, one of the most famous of Gothic monsters. If you take Dracula and turn him into a superhero fighting crime and, ironically, strip him of 
his super powers, Bruce Wayne/Batman is what you get.<br><br>In both cases, you have a man who is super rich and powerful, dark and mysterious, intelligent, ruthless, and a terror in the night, even turning to the form of a bat. He lives in a very old mansion or castle that's been in the family in a Gothic setting. Oh yeah, he even controls animals. Batman has this tech that influences the behavior of bats. So when I said, \"Stripped of super powers\", this is a bit of a misnomer, since Batman imitates some of Dracula's ability through technology.<br><br>Another interesting point, though somewhat off topic, as I thought more about Dracula, it occurred to me where the name probably came from. Dragon in Latin is Draco. I believe this name is inspired by the Book of Revelation, in other words, Dracula is the dragon or the beast. I could probably do a whole another blog post on how Dracula's powers and traits parallel with Satan. But don't read too much into that. I'm by no means arguing that Batman is Satan or anything weird like that.

all unique individuals, so let's start acting like it, embracing our creativity and \"Let it Go\" (Sorry I went there). It's interesting how it all ties into the two fundamental approaches to playing with LEGO's, following the instructions to build the set you bought or inventing your own creations with the same pieces, both being important parts of the experience.<br><br>Something happens toward the end of the movie, something very surprising, that brings the themes of the movie to whole new tender and poignant level.

We have a current view of the future that is very much prolific in the sci fi of today, in 2 primary genres: post apocalyptic and dystopia. Both of these are absolutely staggering in they're popularity.<br><br>For instance, why are zombies all the rage these days? It's because it really is a smaller part of post apocalyptic 
phenomena. And, of course, there also the draw of what's gruesome and morbid and what have you.<br><br>So the question is, what is it with this post apocalyptic and dystopian vision of the future? Why is it our outlook on things so bleak these days? Well, I think you know the answer more or less.<br><br>We live in a troubling time, under the 911 shadow. A time where terrorism is ever so prevalent. A time when unusual episodes of shootings and that seem to be more common. Back when the Columbine one happened, it was a big and shocking deal, due to how unusual the event was, but now many occurrences like it have happened since. We have natural calamities, government corruption, economic turmoil. All kinds of things.<br><br>Now, I don't bring all this up to be Mr Doomsday, but I'm just making the point of what this post apocalyptic and dystopian view of the future is reflecting.<br><br>A couple days ago, I watched the original Superman from 1978, which brought another interesting perspective to my mind, regarding this topic. During the 70's, the movie industry went through an interesting phase, where they stopped making sci fi. When Star Wars came out in 1977, pretty much the last major sci fi film prior to that was Space Odyssey 2001, made in 1968, begging the question of what happened?<br><br>History is what happened. You have the watergate scandal, President Nixon resigning after being caught in corruption, the assassination of JFK, the assassination of John Lennon for Pete's sake, the Vietnam war that many where opposed to. Also, after man reached the moon, there was the looming question of, \"Okay, we're here and there's dirt and rocks, so now what?\" So as pessimism seeped in to society, during all this turmoil, interest in sci fi declined.<br><br>But the end of the 70's ignited into a major sci fi revolution with Star Wars, Superman, E.T., Alien, 
Tron, and whatever else I'm missing. It hasn't gone away since.<br><br>So why is today different? Instead of going away, sci fi just became darker in tone in reflection of current events. I think a major part of this is due to film making technology enabling us to bring to life our compelling speculations of a grim future. The Independence Day movie made back in the 90's set the precedence for this.<br><br>Now, there are other views worth mentioning varying from my current argument. One of which I'd like to call the 2000 effect. Throughout the 20th century, 2000 was bit of a magic number where sometime following it is our magical future. But after passing it up, it's now like, \"Huh, we're here.\" It's the same sort of thing as with landing on the moon, where we go, \"Now what?\"<br><br>Arriving 
here in the new millennium also brings with it hindsight, giving us more realistic views on how technology progresses and that, making us less prone in getting carried away with flying cars, hover boards, and robots serving our every little need.<br><br>We are more inclined to recognize the more natural and incremental way that technology evolves verses a future that manifests itself through spontaneous combustion.<br><br>That brings me to the conclusion on my thoughts of how we view the future today.", "url" : "todays-future" }

What that would mean in this context is creating content that is sensitive as opposed to offensive to whatever groups of people you depict.<br><br>Next, full of patience and long-suffering. Art is work. Hard work. A novel can only be written one day at a time. Great patient is absolutely necessary in a life of a creator. It isn't done when you type the words, \"the end\" either. Creating a product is only the first step. To be worth anything, you have to sell it, which can be even greater work than creating it in the first place.<br><br>Next, temperance in all things. Passion and aspiration are good, but not at the expense of neglecting other important duties like family or personal health. Sacrifice is necessary to make dreams happen, but use good judgment when doing so.<br><br>Next, keep the commandments, which corresponds to points one and two above, humility and submission to God. Many equate keeping the commandments to obeying them, but it goes much deeper than this. This critical point deserves a great deal of expounding, so let's dig in!<br><br>One part of the Old Testament commonly glazed over is the specification for building the Ark of the Covenant. But it was pointed out to me that the Hebrew word used for the Arks walls in those verses is actually the same word for ribs, like with Adam's rib. As they kept the stone tablets with the Law of God in the Ark, it's a symbol of where we need to keep it, written in stone inside our own hearts. How we treasure the Word will be reflected in what we create.<br><br>Joseph Smith wrote, \"If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.\" So we would do well, whenever the so called Muse sends those sparks of inspiration and we're inclined to be intrigued and enchanted by these ideas, to pause and consider what sort of influence it would be. That which encourages one to do good, to be a more decent human, to follow the commandments, and to draw closer to God is of Him. That which does the opposite, to indulge in carnal passions, to rebel against truth, to promote hate and contention, and alienate people from God, comes from Satan.</p><p>To wrap up the points from the Alma scripture, next is asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal. The beautiful thing about being on God's side is that He has your back.<br><br>The last point of the verse above is gratitude. Think about why we create in the first place. We do it out of appreciation of the beauty that surrounds us. The greater our gratitude, the greater the passion we can have in honoring His Almighty Name!<br><br>Perhaps more importantly, when we successfully accomplish great things with our talents, give God the credit! Thank Him for the success!", "url" : "the-muse-is-pagan-dont-follow" }
